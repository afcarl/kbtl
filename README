This repository contains Matlab implementations of the algorithms proposed in "Kernelized Bayesian Transfer Learning", which is appearing in the Proceedings of the 28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014).

demo_binary.m file shows how to use the binary classification algorithm.
demo_multiclass.m file shows how to use the multiclass classification algorithm.
